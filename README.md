## About The Project

This project implements a **fully reproducible workflow** for the automatic classification of stellar types from raw LAMOST DR5 spectra. It combines state-of-the-art data handling, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques tailored for large astronomical datasets.

**Core features include:**
*   🤖 **Automated Workflow:** From data download to model training and reporting.
*   🔭 **Advanced Preprocessing:** Normalization, continuum fitting, denoising.
*   ✨ **Physical Feature Extraction:** Line identification (Hα, Hβ, CaII K&H), FWHM, etc.
*   🧠 **Flexible ML Models:** Random Forest, SVM, with a path to Deep Learning.
*    modular, and designed for extension.

> **Status:** *Active development. See the [Roadmap](https://phd-brown.github.io/astro-spectro-classification/docs/community/roadmap) in our documentation for details.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. For detailed explanations, please refer to our **[full documentation](https://phd-brown.github.io/astro-spectro-classification/docs/getting-started/installation)**.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PhD-Brown/astro-spectro-classification.git
    cd astro-spectro-classification
    ```
2.  **Set up your Python environment**
    ```sh
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the pipeline**
    *   The main entry point is the `notebooks/00_master_pipeline.ipynb` notebook.
    *   For a detailed step-by-step guide, see the **[First Run Tutorial](https://phd-brown.github.io/astro-spectro-classification/docs/getting-started/first-run)**.
